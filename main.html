      <span class="badge">Basic</span> <strong>Embedded System Design</strong>
      The BBC micro:bit uses Button A and Button B as digital inputs, and the built-in temperature and light sensors as analogue inputs. The LED matrix and buzzer provide primary digital output.

<section id="investigation">
  <h2>2. Investigation</h2>

  <p>Research began with understanding how real-world wildfire early warning systems work. The Bosch Forest Fire Detection System [1] uses a network of environmental sensors monitoring temperature, humidity, and gas concentration. Unlike simple threshold-based alarms, these systems use models trained on historical data to detect anomalous conditions before a fire spreads. This was a key insight: reacting to a fixed temperature is not the same as detecting danger relative to context.</p>

  <p>The WWF Guianas early warning network [2] emphasises how detecting <em>rate of change</em> matters more than absolute values. A forest that is normally warm has a different danger profile to one that is usually cool — the same temperature could be safe in one and critical in the other. This directly influenced the decision to use a rolling baseline rather than a hardcoded threshold.</p>

  <p>Research into existing micro:bit environmental projects [3] confirmed that the built-in temperature and light sensors, while not research-grade, are sufficient for simulating environmental monitoring logic. Several examples used fixed thresholds (e.g. "if temperature > 30, alert") but none implemented adaptive baselines on the device itself.</p>

  <p>The EU Climate Change website [4] provided context on how deforestation and rising temperatures interact with wildfire risk — specifically that canopy loss increases direct sunlight reaching the forest floor, drying ground vegetation and raising fire probability. This directly motivated the second what-if scenario in the Python model.</p>

  <p>Based on this research, the key design decisions were: to use a rolling average to define "normal" dynamically; to combine temperature and light as risk factors; and to build the Python model as an offline extension of the same adaptive logic running on the device.</p>
</section>

<!-- SECTION 3 -->
<section id="design">
  <h2>3. Plan and Design</h2>

  <h3>Design Objectives</h3>
  <p>The system needed to meet all basic and advanced requirements while remaining achievable on a BBC micro:bit — a device with no network connectivity, limited memory, and a 5×5 LED display. The core design objective was to build something genuinely adaptive: a system that adjusts its own model of the environment rather than comparing readings to fixed numbers.</p>

  <h3>Options Considered</h3>
  <p>Initially, a simple threshold system was implemented (alert if temperature exceeds 35°C). This was rejected because it does not account for ambient conditions — 33°C might be normal on a hot afternoon but dangerous if the usual baseline is 20°C. The exponential moving average approach was chosen because it is cheap enough to run on the micro:bit in a continuous loop and produces a genuinely adaptive baseline without extra memory storage.</p>
  <p>A Raspberry Pi was considered as an alternative platform but rejected — the micro:bit is sufficient for the sensors required and is more relevant to the embedded systems brief.</p>

  <h3>Stakeholders and End User Needs</h3>
  <p>The primary end user is a forest ranger or environmental monitoring officer who needs to be alerted quickly and clearly. This shaped two decisions: the LED display must be readable at a glance (simple iconic symbols), and the alarm must be audible. A secondary user is a data analyst who would use the logged CSV data and Python model outputs to review historical risk patterns. Their need is for comprehensive, well-labelled data — which is why seven variables are logged per reading, including internal model state.</p>

  <h3>Technologies</h3>
  <p>The embedded system uses MakeCode TypeScript on the BBC micro:bit, providing built-in access to the temperature sensor, light sensor, LED matrix, buzzer, buttons, and datalogger. The computer model is written in Python 3 using only the standard library (csv, os, random, math) so it can be run without installing any packages.</p>

  <h3>System Architecture</h3>
  <p>The system has three concurrent sections on the micro:bit and one offline Python model:</p>

  <img src="flowchart.png" alt="System flowchart showing main loop, logging loop, button handlers and Python model" class="flowchart-img">
  <p style="font-size:0.85rem; color:#555; text-align:center; margin-top:-0.75rem;">Figure 1 — Program flowchart. Three concurrent micro:bit sections feed into an offline Python model.</p>

  <h3>Adaptive Feedback Loop Design</h3>
  <p>The core adaptive loop was designed as: <strong>Sense → Update model → Recalculate thresholds → Score risk → Adapt margins → Respond → Log → repeat.</strong> The warning margins themselves change over time — sustained high risk tightens them (more sensitive), sustained calm relaxes them — so the system's behaviour emerges from its own collected data rather than from hardcoded rules.</p>

  <h3>Development Milestones</h3>
  <div class="timeline">
    <div class="timeline-item">
      <div class="week">Week 1–2</div>
      <h4>Basic Sensor Reading and Display</h4>
      <p>Initial micro:bit code read temperature and displayed it on button press. Light level reading added. Simple threshold alert (temp > 35°C = exclamation mark) implemented and tested.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="timeline-item">
      <div class="week">Week 3–4</div>
      <h4>Logic Bug Fixes</h4>
      <p>Three significant logic errors identified: the light variable was only read once at startup; the else-if chain made the freezing condition and temperature drop detection unreachable; and the temperature drop check was inside the same chain as the rise check, preventing both from triggering. All were corrected by restructuring into separate if-blocks and moving sensor reads into the loop.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="timeline-item">
      <div class="week">Week 5–6</div>
      <h4>Adaptive Model Implementation</h4>
      <p>Replaced the fixed 35°C threshold with an exponential moving average baseline. Dynamic thresholds calculated from the baseline. Fire risk score (0–4) introduced combining temperature and light. Warning margin adaptation added based on alertCount and allClearCount.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="timeline-item">
      <div class="week">Week 7–8</div>
      <h4>Logging and Display Modes</h4>
      <p>Datalogger integrated with seven variables per reading. Adaptive log interval implemented (1–4 seconds by risk level). Button B display cycle (displayMode counter with modulo) added to show T, R, B, and TH readings on demand.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="timeline-item">
      <div class="week">Week 9–10</div>
      <h4>Python Model and What-If Scenarios</h4>
      <p>Python model written to replicate the adaptive algorithm offline. Two what-if scenarios implemented: sudden heatwave (+8°C with freeze_baseline=True) and canopy loss (light ×1.4). Results compared in a final output table.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="timeline-item">
      <div class="week">Week 11–12</div>
      <h4>Testing and Report</h4>
      <p>Final testing of all branches. Report written. Video recorded demonstrating all features.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <h3>Testing</h3>
  <p>Testing was carried out throughout development. For the micro:bit, the temperature sensor was tested by warming the device with a hand to trigger the alert condition and checking that the alarm fired correctly. The Button A light modes were tested in a dark room, dim light, normal room light, and direct bright light. The rolling average was verified by watching the B: display value shift gradually over several minutes as ambient temperature changed.</p>
  <p>For the Python model, the three scenarios were verified by checking that the baseline produced a low average risk on realistic data, that the heatwave scenario with freeze_baseline produced a large number of critical events, and that the canopy loss scenario increased high-light events by the expected proportion.</p>

  <h3>A Problem Encountered</h3>
  <p>The most significant problem was an unreachable condition bug in the temperature display logic. The original code had a chain of else-if blocks checking: temperature > 35, then temperature < 35, then temperature < 0, then temperature drop. Because temperature < 35 catches every value below 35, the checks for below zero and for temperature drops could never be reached. The fix was to separate the conditions into independent if-blocks and reorder them so the most specific check (below zero) came before the general check (below 35). This was identified by manually tracing through the code with test values (e.g. −2°C) and noting that the freezing icon never appeared.</p>

  <h3>The Python Model</h3>
  <p>The Python model processes a dataset of environmental readings — either exported from the micro:bit datalogger as a CSV, or a built-in simulated dataset if no file is present. It runs the same adaptive algorithm as the micro:bit: exponential moving average baseline, dynamic thresholds, fire risk scoring, and margin adaptation. The key function is <code>run_model()</code>, which accepts a <code>temp_offset</code>, a <code>light_multiplier</code>, and a <code>freeze_baseline</code> flag to configure each scenario.</p>

  <p>Scenario 1 uses <code>freeze_baseline=True</code> to model a sudden unexpected heatwave before the system has had time to recalibrate — this represents the most dangerous real-world case. Scenario 2 simulates deforestation removing tree canopy, increasing the direct sunlight reaching the forest floor and pushing more readings above the light threshold. The combined scenario shows that heatwave and canopy loss together produce a worst-case outcome significantly worse than either alone.</p>

<section id="evaluation">
  <h2>5. Evaluation</h2>

  <p>The final artefact successfully meets all basic and advanced requirements of the brief. The embedded system collects real environmental data, simulates wildfire risk, and adapts its own sensitivity based on sustained conditions. The Python model extends this to a full dataset analysis with two meaningful what-if scenarios that produce clearly different and explainable outcomes.</p>

  <p>The adaptive model performs well as a concept: the exponential moving average correctly shifts the baseline over time, and the margin adaptation demonstrably changes the system's behaviour under sustained alerts. The logged data includes the internal model state (warning_margin, rolling baseline, dynamic threshold), which makes the adaptation visible and verifiable — an examiner can open the CSV and see the margins change over the course of a run.</p>

  <p>There are clear limitations. The micro:bit temperature sensor is affected by heat generated by the device itself, which introduces a small upward bias in readings. The light sensor is affected by the angle at which the device is held. In a real deployment, calibrated external sensors would be used. The current model also uses temperature and light as proxies for wildfire risk, but a more complete model would include humidity and wind speed — both of which significantly affect real fire spread.</p>

  <h3>Future Improvements</h3>
  <p>The most valuable next step would be to connect external sensors via the GPIO pins — particularly a DHT22 humidity sensor and a soil moisture sensor. Humidity is arguably more important than temperature alone for wildfire risk, since dry vegetation is what actually burns. Soil moisture would allow the model to simulate drought cycle detection, another key example from the brief.</p>
  <p>The Python model could also be extended with a time-series prediction component — using the rolling average trend to forecast where the baseline is heading and flag risk before it arrives, rather than only scoring current conditions.</p>
